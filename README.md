### Overview

ShortLink is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://indicina.co` and it returns
a short URL such as `http://short.est/GeAi9K`. Visiting the shortened URL should redirect the user to the
long URL. Using the example above, visiting `http://short.est/GeAi9K` should redirect the user to `https://indicina.co`

### Features

- `encode`: Encode a URL to a shortened URL
- `decode`: Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL
- `statistic/{url_path}`: Return the basic statistics of a short URL path. Using the above link, `url_path` will be `GeAi9K`.

### Project Structure

Overall, the project is designed to be scalable, maintainable and extensible. The use of a monolithic architecture that can easily spin off to a micro-service following modular architecture pattern that promotes code organization and separation of concerns.
